# RecipeTranslator
Translates Recipes in a text file

This is a simple recipe translator using google translate implemented by the deep-translator package.

Running:
Open it in intellij and run it.
(You may be able to run it from terminal, I haen't tested it)
input the full file location of the recipe text file into the gui and the name of the language you want to convert it to

Plug: You can use my recipeFinder on github to get files of recipes to translate!
